                There are 800 million players worldwide who play volleyball at least once a week. Volleyball
                is a sport that is safe, fun and does not require extreme fitness. Since you don’t have to move around
                the court too fast, it’s great for people who want a low-impact sport that will help them get fit without
                pushing them to their limit.
                <p>For those who are a bit more competitive, the sport is fantastic because games
                can be really exciting and intense, but there’s always a net between you and your opponents.</p>
                <p>BEACH VOLLEYBALL IS SUITABLE FOR PEOPLE OF ALL AGES, AND MEN AND WOMEN ALIKE.</p>
                Anyone considering starting a new sport or exercise program should see a doctor first.
